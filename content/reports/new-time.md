Hey there. Has been a while since i posted anything here.
I am great. Learned a lot of new stuff, met new people and more. Have to admit that was probably the most productive month of my life. 

My [GitHub](https://github.com/Krak9n) page now looks pretty decent.

Finally there is a project in my profile that has more than 10 stars... And now I cannot imagine my life without coding. Everyday this god's craft takes me. 

At this moment I am trying to get better at something niche. 
F.e.: graphics programming, also don't forget about shaders; finally started touching web a bit, gonna make my small website for a resume; 

Also I got very hooked on ricing, and making some cool tools for posting on r/unixporn. As of now have done only two complete rices, and made one pretty cute utility.

Wanted also to talk about future of this blog. I am not going to maintain it as frequently (lol) as I did. Apparently I will post some news here, but it won't be this often. <br />

Anyways, if you will find yourself in a deep desire of talking/reaching to me, write on my email: olhnts12@proton.me, or on my discord: xezbeth45. <br />

**So, what am I going to do now?** 

Well, first of all I am planning on finishing all my old projects, and moving forward. There is a lot of things to learn. 

In the future I still hope to work more on videogames. But maybe I'll also include some audio stuff. 

Have a nice day, everyone.
